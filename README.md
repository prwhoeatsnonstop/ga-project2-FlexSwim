Project #2: Building Your First Full-Stack Application

#Title: FlexSwim

#Concept Design

#Problem Statement
Swimming is a sport that requires a lot of practice, proper technique, and training.
Discipline is tough if there is nothing to hold them accountable in practicing the various swimming strokes they have learned

#Solution Statement
Provide an app that gives swimmers flexibility to choose from planned swimming workouts, or they can edit any and all workouts according to their schedule

#User-Stories
1. As a swimmer, I want to track my distance, duration and strokes (a complete cycle of a chosen workout)
2. As a swimmer, I want to create a list of finished workouts so I can see how much time have I spent on practicing a particular stroke and cover how many kilometres
3. As a swimmer, I want to know which stroke I should pay more attention to as I may have neglected some strokes
4. As a swimmer, I want to edit/delete my workout schedule so that it fits my current working schedule
